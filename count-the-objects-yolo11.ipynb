        "# Object Counting using Ultralytics YOLO11\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook serves as a starting point for [counting objects](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/object-counting/) in videos or live streams using the YOLO11 model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Object Counting?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Object counting with YOLO11 involves accurate identification and counting of specific objects in videos and camera streams. YOLO11 excels in real-time applications, providing efficient and precise object counting for various scenarios like crowd analysis and surveillance, thanks to its state-of-the-art algorithms and deep learning capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Object Counting?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Resource Optimization**: Object counting facilitates efficient resource management by providing accurate counts, and optimizing resource allocation in applications like inventory management.\n",
        "- **Enhanced Security**: Object counting enhances security and surveillance by accurately tracking and counting entities, aiding in proactive threat detection.\n",
        "- **Informed Decision-Making**: Object counting offers valuable insights for decision-making, optimizing processes in retail, traffic management, and various other domains."
