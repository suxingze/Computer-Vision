        "# TrackZone using Ultralytics YOLO11\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook serves as a starting point for [tracking objects in zones](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/trackzone/) in videos or live streams using the YOLO11 model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is TrackZone?\n",
        "\n",
        "TrackZone specializes in monitoring objects within designated areas of a frame instead of the whole frame. Built on [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/), it integrates object detection and tracking specifically within zones for videos and live camera feeds. YOLO11's advanced algorithms and [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) technologies make it a perfect choice for real-time use cases, offering precise and efficient object tracking in applications like crowd monitoring and surveillance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Object Tracking in Zones (TrackZone)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Targeted Analysis:** Tracking objects within specific zones allows for more focused insights, enabling precise monitoring and analysis of areas of interest, such as entry points or restricted zones.\n",
        "- **Improved Efficiency:** By narrowing the tracking scope to defined zones, TrackZone reduces computational overhead, ensuring faster processing and optimal performance.\n",
        "- **Enhanced Security:** Zonal tracking improves surveillance by monitoring critical areas, aiding in the early detection of unusual activity or security breaches.\n",
        "- **Scalable Solutions:** The ability to focus on specific zones makes TrackZone adaptable to various scenarios, from retail spaces to industrial settings, ensuring seamless integration and scalability."
